# About
Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Am I right, ladies?
The ESP32 Marauder is a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools created for the ESP32 and was originally inspired by [Spacehuhn's](https://github.com/Spacehuhn) [esp8266_deauther](https://github.com/Spacehuhn/esp8366_deauther) project. The tool itself serves as a portable device used to test and analyze WiFi and Bluetooth devices. Use this tool and its firmware with caution as the use of some of its capabilities without explicit consent from the target owner is unlawful in most countries. For more information about this project and how it's assembled, follow the video link below.
**Note:** Because of espressif's ESP32-IDF, the ESP32 included with Marauder is incapable of transmitting deauthentication frames.

You can check out the marauder article written [here](https://www.hackster.io/news/esp32-marauder-puts-a-bluetooth-wi-fi-pen-testing-toolkit-in-your-pocket-32d389f6e66f) as well as other interesting engineering projects.

## Capabilities
### Current
- Probe Request Sniff: Sniff for WiFi [probe request frames](https://mrncciew.com/2014/10/27/cwap-802-11-probe-requestresponse/) sent by wireless devices
- Beacon Sniff: Sniff [beacon frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_frame) sent by wireless acccess points
- Beacon Spam Random: Spam hundreds of random beacon frames to wireless devices within range
- Rick Roll Beacon: Broadcast the rick roll lyrics as WiFi access points
- Bluetooth Sniffer: Sniff bluetooth devices within range
- Detect Card Skimmers: Detect bluetooth enabled credit card skimmers
- Packet Monitor: Show WiFi packet density on a given channel using a time bar graph
- Deauthentication Packet Sniffer: Detect deauthentication packets sent on all channels
- Draw: Just doodle on the screen or whatever

### Developing
- Emulate Bluetooth: Emulate a bluetooth device with a specific name
- OTA Firmware Update: Update Marauder firmware over the air with .bin file

# Do It Yourself

13. Click `ESP32 Sketch Data Upload` and wait for the SPIFFS upload to finish
14. Click the upload button
  
# Under Development
Currently the ESP32 Marauder has limited firmware capabilities. Most of the work so far has been put into designing the hardware. New firmware features will be added over time and will eventually reach a point where this project will be a fully capable hacking machine.

# Special Thanks
- [Spacehuhn](https://github.com/spacehuhn) for an easy to use linked list library [SimpleList](https://github.com/spacehuhn/SimpleList)
  - Also a well designed menu structure. I adapted it to the TFT GUI because it worked perfectly
- [Bodmer](https://github.com/Bodmer) for a comprehensive TFT touch screen library [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
- [HyderHasnain](https://github.com/hyderhasnain) for an adaptable [line graph](https://github.com/hyderhasnain/arduino_touchscreen_controller/blob/master/Code/AccelGraph_Original.ino) to be used as the packet monitor
